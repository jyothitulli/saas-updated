System Architecture Design
1. System Architecture Diagram

The high-level system architecture consists of the following components:

Client (Browser): The interface through which end users interact with the application.

Frontend Application: Handles the user interface, renders views, and communicates with the backend API.

Backend API Server: Provides business logic, handles requests from the frontend, and interacts with the database.

Database: Stores all persistent data, including tenant-specific data and user information.

Authentication Flow: Ensures secure access via login, JWT tokens, and role-based authorization.

2. Database Schema Design
(./images/database-erd.png)
The database schema is designed to support multi-tenant isolation and maintain data integrity.

Key Features:

All tables that store tenant-specific data include a tenant_id column for isolation.

Foreign keys and indexes are highlighted to optimize relationships and query performance.

Tables include Users, Tenants, Projects, Tasks, and related entities.

Highlights:

Foreign Keys: Clearly marked to indicate relationships between tables.

Indexes: Applied on frequently queried columns to improve performance.

Tenant Isolation: tenant_id present in all relevant tables to ensure data separation.

3. API Architecture

/api/auth/refresh	POST	Yes	Any	Refresh JWT token
3.2 Tenants Module
Endpoint	Method	Auth Required	Role Required	Description
/api/tenants	GET	Yes	Super Admin	List all tenants
/api/tenants	POST	Yes	Super Admin	Create new tenant
/api/tenants/:id	PUT	Yes	Super Admin	Update tenant details
/api/tenants/:id	DELETE	Yes	Super Admin	Delete tenant
3.3 Users Module
Endpoint	Method	Auth Required	Role Required	Description
